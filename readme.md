# Database project

## Requirements
Wamp 3.2.3
Mysql 8.0.24.0
PHP 8.0.5
Bootstrap

## How to deploy
Copy files into www directory in Wampserver
The link to display the form is: http://localhost/indexForm.php

## Notes
It was fun implementing this test project and it took me about 2 hours.
The implementation using a PHP Framework would require somewhat more than 2 hours, as I am not quite familiar since I am mostly using plain PHP editors. I would be happy to spend more time but it would be unfair.
